    <h1>Final Project Site Plan</h1>
    <h2>Site Name</h2>
    <p>'Hollow Knight: Silksong News.' The site will provide any new information on Silksong, but most of the content will be jokes that the people waiting for this game will get.</p>
    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>Satirical news page for the highly anticipated video game, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Silksong is famous for it's lack of developer communication and news, which is why this 'news' page is satirical.</p>
    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <p>Has there been any news? Is there anything new going on in the community?</p>
    <h2>Color Schema</h2>
    <p>I'm going to go for a darker color scheme, with white text and red accents to match the color scheme and vibe of Silksong</p>
    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>I'm going to use Cinzel for the Header Fonts, as it's the closest google font to Trajan which is what Hollow Knight used. I'll use a sans serif font for the other content to make it easier to read. I'll experiment with which sans serif I like most, but they all look pretty similar.</p>
    <h2>Wireframe</h2>
